## Overview of JUnit

JUnit is a popular framework for writing and running automated tests in Java. It plays a crucial role in the development process, particularly in test-driven development (TDD) and behavior-driven development (BDD), by allowing developers to write unit tests that verify the correctness of their code. Over the years, JUnit has evolved, with JUnit 4 and JUnit 5 (also known as Jupiter) being the most widely used versions.

The **"@"** symbol is used in Java to denote annotations. Annotations are a form of metadata that provide data about a program but are not part of the program itself. In the context of JUnit, annotations are used to mark methods in a test class to perform specific roles in the testing lifecycle. Here are some of the key JUnit annotations and their purposes:

### Common JUnit 4 Annotations

> - **@Test**: Indicates that a method is a test method. This annotation is used to identify methods that contain test code.
> - **@Before**: Specifies that a method will be executed before each test method in the class. It's useful for setting up test environments or initializing common variables.
> - **@After**: Specifies that a method will be executed after each test method in the class. It's typically used for cleanup activities.
> - **@BeforeClass**: Specifies that a method will be executed once before any of the test methods in the class. It must be static.
> - **@AfterClass**: Specifies that a method will be executed once after all the test methods in the class have been run. It's used for cleaning up static resources and must be static.
> - **@Ignore**: Indicates that a test method should be skipped.
>
> ### Key JUnit 5 (Jupiter) Annotations

> - **@Test**: Similar to JUnit 4, it denotes a test method.
> - **@BeforeEach**: Replaces @Before, indicating that a method should be executed before each test method in the current class.
> - **@AfterEach**: Replaces @After, indicating that a method should be executed after each test method in the current class.
> - **@BeforeAll**: Replaces @BeforeClass, for methods that should run once before any test method in the current class. The method does not need to be static when using the JUnit Jupiter extension model.
> - **@AfterAll**: Replaces @AfterClass, for methods that should run once after all test methods in the current class. Similar to @BeforeAll, methods do not need to be static with the JUnit Jupiter extension model.
> - **@Disabled**: Replaces @Ignore, used to disable a test method.
> - **@DisplayName**: Allows providing a custom name for the test class or method.
> - **@Nested**: Allows nesting test classes to create a hierarchical organization of tests.

## JUnit 5 (Jupiter) Advanced Mechanism

JUnit 5 (Jupiter) introduces more advanced mechanisms for selecting classes and packages, making use of its new architecture and the `@SelectPackages` and `@SelectClasses` annotations.

- **@SelectPackages:** Allows you to select specific packages to include in the test plan. When you use this annotation with the JUnit Platform, you can specify one or more package names. This is particularly useful for running a subset of tests grouped by package.

  ```
  javaCopy code
  @SelectPackages("com.example.myapp.tests.integration")
  ```

- **@SelectClasses:** Enables you to select specific test classes to include in the test plan. This can be useful when you want to run tests from certain classes but not others.

  ```
  javaCopy code
  @SelectClasses({MyFirstTestClass.class, MySecondTestClass.class})
  ```

- **Using Tags to Select Tests:** Another powerful feature in JUnit 5 is the ability to use tags to include or exclude tests. By annotating test classes or methods with `@Tag("myTag")`, you can then configure your test runner to only run tests with certain tags.

### Configuring in Build Tools

Both Maven and Gradle have been updated to support JUnit 5, including the ability to select packages and classes through their respective configurations:

- **Maven:** Using the `maven-surefire-plugin`, you can configure includes and excludes, and with JUnit 5 support, you can also leverage tags and other JUnit Platform features.
- **Gradle:** Offers similar capabilities with its test task, allowing you to include or exclude packages, use tags, and more, with JUnit 5's platform support.
